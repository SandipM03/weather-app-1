what all I need to implement in this app?

    1.  A search bar with placeholder Address, City or Zip Code

    2.  A component which displays temperature with some weather details

    3.  A good looking component



achieved

    -   a responsive ui
    -   api is fetching data properly
    -   deployed flask api on ec2
    -   bought domain and running api on cadbay-api.cadbay.in
    -   added cors(app) to flask app
    -   location data is successfully bieng retrieved from the flask endpoint
    -   a suggestion box below the search bar

todo:

    -   clicking on the location or the search button shows the weather forecast
        component
            -   fetch the data from weather api
    -   make the app with mobile first approach


do one by one


    -   extract lon and lat data from the from the locationArray
    -   then put the lon and lat in the weather api call
    -   extract temp, clouds %, feels like
    -   round of temp and feels like

    -   save all of the code in the actual index, style and script files out of the
        test folder


Solve this

    -   achieve some way of checking which result matches the name value of location array
    -   and then fetch the weather of that location
    -   don't show the options below the search box
